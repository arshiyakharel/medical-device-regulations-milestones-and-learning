- Regulations are necessary in medicine to prevent catastrophic events and injury/damage to patients and healthcare providers
- These regulations will help to prevent scandals around medical devices such as the thalidomide controversy or PIP scandal around faulty breast implants. 

SAFETY AND EFFICACY:
- In the regulatory context, safety indicates a risk for a specific adverse event that is low enough to be considered
“acceptable”.
- The acceptability of a risk level is defined in relation to the severity of the adverse event on the patient.
- Safety of a product can be assessed experimentally or computationally for adverse effects that have already been observed. 
- Clinical trials normally should be here never seen before adverse effects can be reported. 
- Obviously this is not always the case so modern day regulatory systems include post-marketing surveillance in their products. 

FAILURE:
- In the context of medical devices, Failure means not meeting a desirable or intended objective.
objectives of regulatory processes are:
- the medical device should not worsen the health of the recipinet (safety)
- the device must complete is desired effect (effectiveness)

SAFETY and EFFICACY
• Safety: the product has an acceptably low risk of producing any adverse effect
• Efficacy: the product does positively affect the health of the patients as claimed by the manufacturer

SAFETY FLOW OF A MEDICAL DEVICE.
To safely go from lab to market a medical device normally undergoes the following stages:
1. New product
2a. Laboratory testing
2b. Animal Testing
3a. Phase I Clinical trial
3b. Phase II Clinical trial
3c. Phase III Clinical trial
4. Post Market Surveillance

TYPES OF MEDICAL PRODUCT 
MEDICINAL PRODUCT: A substance(s) presented for diagnosing, treating or preventing disease in humans or animals. 
MEDICAL DEVICE: "Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other
article, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of
the following specific medical purposes: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or
alleviation of disease; diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or disability;
investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or
state; control or support of conception; cleaning, disinfection or sterilisation of any of the above."

DRUG DEVICE SEPARATION
Regulators use the drug-device separation criteria to distinguish wether a product is a drug or medical device. 
They do this by:
Step 1: Intended Purpose - Look at the intended use of the product, considering how it is presented to the user.
Step 2: Principal Intended Action - 
Determine how the product achieves its main effect.
Three possible mechanisms indicating a drug action:
Pharmacological Means
Interaction of the substance with cellular components (usually receptors).
Can produce a direct effect or block another agent.
Evidence: Dose–response correlation often indicates pharmacological action.
Example: Painkillers interacting with prostaglandin pathways.

Immunological Means
Involves stimulating or mobilizing the immune system.
Usually specific, e.g., vaccines.
Example: Activating antibodies against an infection.

Metabolic Means
Alters normal body chemical processes (start, stop, or change the speed).
Example: Enzyme replacement therapy or drugs that affect metabolism.

OVERALL:
If a product achieves its main effect through pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic means, it is likely a drug.
If it achieves its effect by physical, mechanical, or purely structural means, it may be a medical device.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND COUNTRIES:
- Different countries have different regulatory frameworks.
- When making a device you should focus on the framework of the country you would like to sell in not where you are necessarily making the device.
- In Europe we use CE Marking. It is also recognised in Australia. 
- In the US, the FDA is responsible for medical device supervision and control among other products.
- Recently in the UK, a new system is being introduced,the UKCA Mark. (this is not in NI, they still use CE marking)

TAXONOMY:
Medical Deices can be split into 3 main categories:
- active medical devices - a medical device whos operation depends on a source of energy other than that generated by the human body, software is included.
- passive medical devices
- in-vitro diagnostic devices - An IVD medical device can include:
Reagents, kits, calibrators, control materials
Instruments, apparatus, equipment, software, or systems
Used alone or in combination
Key point: The manufacturer must intend it for in vitro use — meaning testing is done outside the human body on specimens like blood, tissue, or other bodily fluids.

The definition of a Medical Device according to the EU regulation is found in lecture notes.
