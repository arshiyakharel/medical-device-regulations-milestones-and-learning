1. STED Structure
STED (Summary Technical Documentation) is a standardized format used to demonstrate that a medical device (including IVDs) conforms to Essential Principles of Safety and Performance.
Core Components of STED include:
. Device Description & Product Specification (including variants)
• Labelling
• Design and Manufacturing Information
• Essential Principles (EP) Checklist
!!• Risk Analysis and Control Summary!!
• Product Verification and Validation
• Declaration of Conformity

Risk is the combination of the probability of harm occurring and the severity of that harm.
Risk Analysis is a Systematic process that involves:
- documenting the intended use and characteristic related to the safety of a device
- identification of hazards
- Estimation of the risks for each harm 

Risk analysis: CE vs. FDA
The FDA recognises ISO 14971:2007 while EU CE Marking required EN ISO 14971:2019
The differences between the 2007 and 2019 version of ISO 14971 include:
Negligible Risks:
EU: All risks must be reduced as far as possible
FDA: Negligible risks may be ignored
Risk Acceptability:
EU: Manufacturer-defined acceptability thresholds are not sufficient
Risks must be reduced even if considered acceptable
Economic Considerations:
EU: Cost cannot justify not reducing risk
FDA: Cost–benefit considerations are allowed
Risk–Benefit Analysis:
EU: Performed only after all risk reduction measures
FDA: May be used earlier in the process

Probability Estimates 
The estimates of the probability of risk should be supported with:
Published standards, expert opinion, clinical evidence, SOLID DATA.

Risk levels are determined in a severity-probability risk matrix:
R1 – Low risk
Low severity and/or low probability
Usually acceptable, minimal or no action needed
R2 – Medium risk
Moderate concern
Risk control measures should be considered
R3 – High risk
Significant risk
Risk reduction is required
R4 – Very high / unacceptable risk
High severity and high probability
Must be reduced before the device can be acceptable

There are a variety of risk analysis techniques that can be used, here are 4:
Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA): Used in the early development process to identify hazards when few details of the medical device design are known.
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA): is especially useful in safety engineering, early in the development stages, for the
identification and prioritization of hazards and hazardous situations as well as for analysing adverse events. 
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA):  techniques by which an effect or consequences of individual components are systematically identified and is more
appropriate as the design matures.
Hazard Operability Study (HAZOP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) are typically used
in the latter stages of the development phase to verify and then optimize design concepts or changes

RISK CONTROL:
Risk control is applied when identified risks are too high and involves:
Risk reduction: Actions taken to lower unacceptable risks
Risk control option analysis: Identify and rank control measures using this hierarchy:
Inherent safety by design
Protective measures (device or manufacturing)
Information for safety (warnings, IFU)
Implementation & verification: Selected controls must be implemented and verified for correct implementation and effectiveness
Residual risk evaluation: Remaining risk is evaluated against criteria in the risk management plan
Risk–benefit analysis: If residual risk is still unacceptable and cannot be further reduced, benefits may be weighed against risks
New risks from controls: Risk controls must be reviewed to ensure they do not introduce new hazards
Completeness: All identified hazardous situations must be addressed

An example of risk control within a medical device can be with - Implantable Pacemaker
The Hazard: loss of functionality
Hazardous Situation: Pacemaker stops functioning due to early battery depletion
Inherently safe design: Use Reliable long-life batteries
Protective Measure: Alarm before battery depletion
Info for safety: information on typical battery lifetime. 

Linking back to FDA vs. CE, ISO 14971:2007 suggest to reduce risk “As Low As Reasonably Possible” (ALARP), BS EN ISO 14971:2019 requires
that risk is reduced “As Far As Possible” (AFAP)
To go into more detail:
ALARP - this is based on the belief that overall risk can never be completely removed
 If the risk is “negligible”, in the sense that it conceptually exists but its probability is below the detectability
threshold, it can be discarded
• Even if a risk is measurable, it can be accepted by the manufacturer if:
• The risk cannot be reduced any further, or its reduction would prevent the commercialisation, AND
• The risk the device exposes the patient to is lower than the benefit the patient would receive from the
device

AFAP: This is based on the beleif that patient health always comes first.
• Any risk, even if negligible, cannot be discarded, must be targeted for reduction, and included in the riskbenefit analysis
• The manufacturer has no discretionary power to decide a risk is acceptable. All risks should be reduced as far
as possible
• A key point is that cost should not be a factor. According to the regulation a manufacturer cannot accept a risk
simply because reducing it would be too expensive.

overall, comparing CE and FDA (510k), CE is more demanding as every device requires a full risk analysis while the FDA is more lenient. 
A device 510(k)-certified may have risk-related problems to get CE mark with:
• compliance with ISO 14971:2007 instead of BS EN ISO 14971:2019
• reduction of risks as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) instead of reducing risks as far as possible (AFAP)
• reducing risks by notifying users and patients of residual risks in the Indication for Use
• only addressing unacceptable risks with risk controls instead of all risks–including negligible risks
