Following the BS EN ISO14971:2019 Standard, risk management includes the following steps:
• General requirements for risk management
• Risk analysis - identifies hazards, harms and estimates probability and severity of harm
• Risk evaluation - compares risk against an acceptability criteria and decides wether risk is acceptable or needs control
• Risk control - carried out if risk is unacceptable
• Evaluation of overall residual risk acceptability
• Risk management report
• Production and post-production information

A medical device manufacturer should define a continuous process
throughout the life-cycle of the medical device, for
identifying hazards, estimating and evaluating the
associated risks, controlling these risks, and
monitoring the effectiveness of the controls. 

key elements of the risk management process are:
- risk assessment (which involves risk analysis, estimation and evaluation)
- risk control
a flowchart of the whole process can be found in ISO14971:2019

Top Management should provide evidence of commitment to risk management and allocate qualified personell to reveiw risk.
- determine the policy for risk acceptability 
- periodically revise the suitability of the risk management process 

A risk management plan includes:
• Scope of the risk management activities, and the phases of the device life-cycle to which each activity is
applicable
• Assign responsibilities and authorities
• Set requirements for reviews
• Define criteria for risk acceptability
• Define verification activities
• Define activities related to the collection of production and post-production information

A risk management file is for a particular medical device. 
 For each medical device, a risk management file must include full traceability for the following processes:
• the risk analysis;
• the risk evaluation;
• the implementation and verification of the risk control measures;
• the assessment of the acceptability of any residual risk(s)

Risk analysis and estimate:
This part of the risk management file will include:
• General information
• Description and identification of the medical device that was analysed;
• Identification of the person(s) and organization who carried out the risk analysis;
• Scope and date of the risk analysis
• Intended use and characteristics related to the safety
• Document the intended use
• Reasonably foreseeable misuses
• List characteristics that could affect safety, and define their limits
• Identification of harms
• List and describe known and foreseeable harm associated with the medical device in both normal and fault
conditions
• Estimation of the risk(s) for each hazardous situation
• For each identified harm, estimate the probability that it occurs, and the severity of the effects if it occurs

Different Medical Devices can have different applied standards, standards can help identify hazards
basic standards - general requirements for a broad class of products
group standards - general requirements for specific classes of products
product standards - specific requirements for specific classes of products

Hazards identification:
An example of the hazards identification process can be found in ISO 24971:2020, it includes questions such as:
• Does the device have a restricted shelf-life?
• Factors that should be considered include labelling or indicators and the disposal of such medical
devices when the expiration date is reached
• Is the medical device intended for single use?
• Factors that should be considered include: does the medical device self-destruct after use? Is it obvious
that the device has been used?

Risk Evaluation
After identifying hazards, manufacturers must decide using the criteria for risk acceptability if risk reduction is required.
The results of this risk evaluation shall be recorded in the risk management file

Risk Control:
Risk control will include the following:
• Risk control option analysis
• Implementation of risk control measure(s)
• Residual risk evaluation
• After the risk control measures are applied, any residual risk shall be evaluated using the criteria defined in
the risk management plan.
• Risk/benefit analysis
• Risks arising from risk control measures
• Completeness of risk control
• Compliance is checked by inspection of the risk management file

once all of this is finished the final steps include:
• Risk management report:
• Prior to release for commercial distribution of the medical device, the manufacturer shall carry out a review
of the risk management process.
• Production and post-production information:
• The manufacturer shall establish, document and maintain a system to collect and review information about
the medical device or similar devices in the production and the post-production phases.
• Any event recorded during these processes that may change the risk profile must trigger a risk re-assessment
cycle.
• Informing the user:
• Information for safety: Safety information can be provided to the receiving patient or to the medical
professional involved with the delivery of the medical device. This should explain the proper use of the
device, the consequences of an inappropriate use, what should be done to avoid harm.
• Disclosure of residual risk(s): This should explain the residual risks associated to the device, the
consequences of exposure to such risks, what should be done to avoid harm.

SUMMARY:
Following BS EN ISO 14971:2019, medical device risk management is a continuous, life-cycle process
designed to ensure the safety and performance of the device. It includes risk analysis
(identifying hazards and estimating probability and severity of harm), 
risk evaluation (comparing risks to pre-defined acceptability criteria),
risk control (implementing measures to reduce unacceptable risks),
and the assessment of residual risks. 
The process is documented in a risk management plan and a risk management file for each device, 
which tracks the full traceability of analysis, evaluation, control implementation, and residual risk assessment.
A comprehensive risk management plan defines the scope, responsibilities, criteria for risk acceptability, verification activities,
and procedures for collecting production and post-production data.
Risk analysis includes detailed information about the device, intended use, foreseeable misuse,
hazards, harms, and risk estimation. 
Manufacturers use standards (basic, group, and product-specific) to guide hazard identification,
and may follow guidance such as ISO 24971:2020 to ensure factors like shelf life, single-use design,
labeling, and disposal are considered.

Once risk controls are applied, residual risks are evaluated and, if necessary, a risk–benefit analysis is performed.
The final steps include preparing a risk management report prior to device release, establishing systems to monitor
production and post-production data, and providing safety information to users. This includes instructions for proper use,
warnings about potential harm, and disclosure of residual risks, ensuring that any events changing the risk profile trigger
a reassessment cycle, maintaining ongoing safety throughout the device’s life-cycle.
