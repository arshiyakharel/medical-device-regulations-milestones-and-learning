Principles of Quality:
- customer focus
- leadership
- engagement of people
- improvement
- evidence-based decision-making
- process approach
- relationship management

Why we need a QMS?
- it helps to demonstrate that your product has the necessary requirements of safety and efficacy
- it is based on samples of products that were tested, analysed and verified
- the QMS ensures that all other copies of the product will not be significantly different from those tested

Control vs. Assurance
• Quality Control is oriented to the product; Quality Assurance is oriented to the process
• Design: you can certify the prototype (as materialisation of the design), or the design process
• Production: you can certify how you control the quality of a single product, or by which process you assure
the quality of your entire production
• Management: you certify a fixed management structure, or the process through which the management is
monitored and revised

ISO 13485:2016 – Quality Management Systems for Medical Devices
ISO 13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system (QMS) where an organisation must demonstrate its ability to consistently meet regulatory and customer requirements for medical devices.

Process Approach (PDCA Cycle)

ISO 13485 follows the Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA) model.
Organisations shall:
Define required QMS processes and their application
Apply a risk-based approach to process control
Define process sequence and interactions

For each process:
Define criteria and methods for effective operation and control
Ensure adequate resources and information
Implement actions to achieve planned results
Monitor, measure, and analyse performance
Maintain records demonstrating conformity

Change Control:
Assess impact of changes on:
the QMS
medical devices produced
Control changes according to the standard
Validate software used in the QMS and retain records
QMS Documentation Requirements

Key documents include:
Quality Policy & Objectives – top management commitment
Quality Manual – QMS scope, exclusions, procedures, process interactions
Procedures – instructions for performing activities
Records – evidence of QMS operation over time
Medical Device Files – documentation demonstrating device conformity

Management Responsibilities
The QMS must define:
Management commitment and customer focus
Quality policy and objectives
Roles, responsibilities, and communication
Management review processes
Resource management
Work environment and contamination control

Product Realisation
QMS must control the full product lifecycle, including:
Product realisation planning
Determination of product requirements and customer communication
Design and development:
planning, inputs, outputs
review, verification, validation
design transfer and change control
Purchasing and supplier control
Production and service provision:
process control
cleanliness and sterility
installation and servicing
identification and traceability
Control and calibration of measurement equipment

Monitoring & Measurement
The effectiveness of the QMS is monitored through:
Customer feedback
Complaint handling
Regulatory reporting
Internal audits to verify:
conformity to planned arrangements
effective implementation and maintenance
