Testing Biocompatibility of a product is addressed in ISO 10993, 
This is a huge standard (20 parts) that covers things from Animal testing, Sample preparation, characterisation of materials, identifying degradation products from different materials (polymer, ceramics, metals etc.)

Biocompatibility testing and standards aim to evaluate biological risks and adverse reactions arising from the use of medical devices
It focuses on the interaction of the device with living tissues it may contact. 
Biological risk can stem from the material, shape, finishing of a medical device. 
Overall this standard does not operate on a pass/fail criteria and is intended for use by specialists with adequate training and experience. 

Part 1 of ISO 10993 is: "Evaluation and testing within a risk management process" which aims to:
• Define the general principles governing biocompatibility tests
• Categorise devices based on the duration and nature of the contact with the body
• Collect all available data, and perform gap identification via risk analysis
• Generate additional data to have a complete assessment of the biological safety of the medical devices

Specialists will look out for:
• The material(s) used to manufacture the device;
• Intended additives, process residues and contaminants;
• Extractables: substances that can be released from a medical device or material using extraction solvents and/or
extraction conditions that are expected to be at least as aggressive as the conditions of clinical use;
• Leachable substances: this means liquids that drain away from a solid, possibly as a result of wash-out process by
a bodily fluid;
• Degradation products;
• Physical characteristics, such as surface morphology, particle size and shape, porosity, etc.

Logical workflow of this first part is as follows:
1. Is the device in direct or indirect contact with the body? ➛ if not, ISO10993 does not apply
2. Is the device biocompatibility equivalent to that of another commercially available, in term of materials,
chemical composition, manufacturing and sterilisation, and type of body contact? ➛ if yes, do only risk
assessment
3. Are there in the literature enough data to support the biocompatibility of the device in term of toxicology for all
involved chemicals, even in mixtures, and for the doses and route of exposure observed in this device? ➛ if yes,
only risk assessment
4. If not enough data exist, perform necessary tests, and then do the risk assessment

Devices are split into categories (by contact and by duration)
By contact:
- surface contacting device: band-aid, contact lens etc.
- external communicating device: dialysers, dental cements, intravenous systems etc. 
- implant device: hip replacement, pacemaker, stent etc. 

By duration:
- limited exposure - contact upto 24h
- prolonged exposure - contact between 24h - 30d
- permanent contact - contact exceeds 30d

EVALUATION OF BIOCOMPATIBILITY:
Material characterization
Medical devices must first be chemically characterized according to ISO 10993-18 and ISO/TS 10993-19.
This means identifying:
All chemical constituents of the material
Manufacturing residues
Intended additives (e.g. stabilizers, plasticizers)

Risk-based additional testing
Depending on the risk profile of the device (type of contact with the body, duration of contact, and existing data), further testing may be required:
Leachables (chemicals that may migrate out of the device) → ISO 10993-17
Degradation products (chemicals formed when the device breaks down) → ISO 10993-9, -13, -14, -15
The goal is to understand what chemicals the patient could be exposed to and in what amounts.

Biological evaluation tests
By default, biological safety tests are conducted in vivo (animal tests) according to ISO 10993-2.
Animal testing can be avoided if:
Reliable results already exist from previous studies, or
Existing pre-clinical and clinical data and a history of safe use are sufficient.
This reflects both scientific efficiency and ethical responsibility.

2. How tests are selected and conducted
Key principles
Tests must be performed on the final, sterile product, not just raw materials.

Test selection depends on:
Type and duration of contact with the body
Frequency and conditions of exposure
Chemical and physical nature of the device
Known toxicology of involved chemicals
Surface area of the device relative to patient body size
Existing scientific literature
Sensitivity and specificity of the test

Hazard exclusion
Some hazards do not apply if a mechanism of harm is excluded.
Example: If no chemicals can leach out, systemic toxicity testing may not be needed.

Quality and ethics
All tests must:
Follow Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
Be reproducible, repeatable, and robust
Animal testing must comply with the 3Rs (see below).

3. Toxicology (what it is and why it matters)
Toxicology is:
The study of harmful effects of chemicals on living organisms
Also includes diagnosing and treating toxic exposures
Key factors considered:
Dose–response relationship (how much causes harm)
Route of exposure (skin, ingestion, inhalation, implantation)
Species, sex, and environment
This information is used to assess whether exposure from a medical device is safe or harmful.

4. Sensitivity and specificity (test performance)
These terms describe how good a binary test (positive/negative) is:

Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)
How well the test detects a real hazard
Example: % of truly HIV-positive patients correctly identified

Specificity (True Negative Rate)
How well the test avoids false alarms
Example: % of healthy people correctly identified as healthy

Important insight:
A test that always says “positive” has:
100% sensitivity
0% specificity
This distinction matters because false positives and false negatives have different clinical consequences, even if overall accuracy looks good.

5. The Three Rs (ethical use of animals)
The 3Rs framework ensures humane animal research:
Replacement – avoid animal use where possible
Reduction – use the minimum number of animals
Refinement – minimize suffering and improve welfare

Key points:
The 3Rs are embedded in laws, regulations, and funding policies
Public acceptance of animal research depends on applying the 3Rs
In the UK, this is promoted by the NC3Rs organisation

6. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
GLP is a quality management system for laboratories performing pre-clinical tests.
Its purpose:
Ensure consistency, reliability, reproducibility, and integrity of data
It commonly relies on:
ISO/IEC 17025:2005, which sets competence requirements for testing laboratories

7. Reproducibility, repeatability, and robustness (ISO 10993 terms)
In ISO 10993 context:
Repeatability
Same lab, same team, same method → same results
Reproducibility
Different labs or teams → same results
Robustness
Results are not affected by small environmental or procedural changes
These qualities ensure that test results are scientifically trustworthy and regulator-acceptable.
