DEFINITIONS
>DEFINITIONS: Duration
• Transient: Normally intended for continuous use for less than 60 minutes.
• Short term: Normally intended for continuous use for between 60 minutes and 30 days.
• Long term: Normally intended for continuous use for more than 30 days.

>DEFINITIONS: Invasive Devices
• Invasive device: A device which, in whole or in part, penetrates inside the body, either through a body orifice or
through the surface of the body
• Body orifice: Any natural opening in the body, as well as the external surface of the eyeball, or any permanent
artificial opening, such as a stoma
• Surgically invasive device: An invasive device which penetrates inside the body through the surface of the body
(including through mucous membranes of body orifices) with the aid or in the context of a surgical operation; or a
device that produces penetration other than through a body orifice
• Implantable device: Any device which is intended:
• to be totally introduced into the human body or,
• to replace an epithelial surface or the surface of the eye
• by clinical intervention which is intended to remain in place after the procedure.
• Any device intended to be partially introduced into the human body by clinical intervention and intended to
remain in place after the procedure for at least 30 days is also considered an implantable device.

>DEFINITIONS: Others
• Reusable surgical instrument: Instrument intended for surgical use in cutting, drilling, sawing, scratching,
scraping, clamping, retracting, clipping or similar procedures, without connection to any active medical device
and which can be reused after appropriate procedures have been carried out.
• Active device: Any medical device operation of which depends on a source of electrical energy or any source of
power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity and which acts by converting this energy.
Medical devices intended to transmit energy, substances or other elements between an active medical device and
the patient, without any significant change, are not considered to be active medical devices. Stand alone
software is considered to be an active medical device.
• Active therapeutic device: Any active device, whether used alone or in combination with other medical devices,
to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures with a view to treatment or alleviation of
an illness, injury or disability.
• Active device intended for diagnosis and monitoring: Any active device used, whether alone or in combination
with other devices, to supply information for detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological
conditions, states of health, illnesses or congenital deformities.
• Central circulatory system: means the following vessels: arteriae pulmonales, aorta ascendens, arcus aorta,
aorta descendens to the bifurcatio aortae, arteriae coronariae, arteria carotis communis, arteria carotis externa,
arteria carotis interna, arteriae cerebrales, truncus brachiocephalicus, venae cordis, venae pulmonales, vena
cava superior, vena cava inferior.
• Central nervous system: means the brain, meninges and spinal cord

IMPLEMENTING RULES - A summary
Device classification is based on the intended purpose.
Devices used together are classified separately, including accessories.
Software is classified with the device it drives or influences; standalone software is classified independently.
Devices not intended for a specific body part are classified according to their most critical use.
When multiple rules apply, the strictest rule leading to the highest classification is used.

RISK CLASSES - A concept
Medical devices are divided in risk classes:
• The more vital is the portion of the body they interact with the higher is the risk class
• Implicit hierarchy shared by most systems:
1. Death
2. Loss of cognitive function
3. Loss of reproductive function
4. Permanent disability
5. Temporary disability and suffering
• The complexity of the certification process increases as the risk class increases

ELEMENTS OF PROCESS
These are the key regulatory steps or components that a manufacturer must follow to demonstrate that a medical device complies with applicable regulations throughout its entire lifecycle.
• Declaration of conformity
• Essential requirements for the device
• Production quality assurance
• Clinical evaluation
• Post-marketing surveillance

ANNEXES
The Annexes of EU MDR 2017/745 explain what manufacturers must do to prove a medical device is safe, works properly, and can be legally sold in the EU. The device’s risk class determines which approval process is required, with higher-risk devices undergoing stricter assessment.

DEVICE CLASSIFICATIONS
Medical Device Classification (EU MDR) – Summary
Medical devices are classified based on invasiveness, duration of use, activity, and risk. Higher risk leads to a higher class (I → IIa → IIb → III).

1. Non-invasive devices (Rules 1–4)
Generally Class I.
Class IIa/IIb if they store or channel blood/body fluids, modify biological or chemical composition, or manage injured skin.
Class III if substances are used in vitro with human tissues or embryos.

2. Invasive devices (Rules 5–8)
Classification increases with duration of use (transient → short-term → long-term/implantable).
Class III for devices in contact with the heart, central circulatory system or CNS, those with biological effects, chemical changes, or administering medicines.
Most implants are Class IIb, but many (e.g. joint replacements, breast implants, spinal implants) are Class III.

3. Active devices (Rules 9–13)
Usually Class IIa.
Class IIb if energy delivery, monitoring, or diagnosis could be hazardous or involves ionising radiation.
Class III if controlling active implantable devices.
Software is classified based on clinical impact, with highest risk software in Class III.

4. Special rules (Rules 14–22)
Class III for devices containing medicinal substances, human/animal tissues, nanomaterials with high exposure, or systemic absorption.
Class IIb for contraception devices, disinfecting contact lenses, and inhalation drug delivery.
Certain imaging, sterilisation, and substance-based devices fall into Class IIa or IIb.

Overall:
Device class increases with invasiveness, duration, activity, and potential patient risk, with Class III representing the highest risk and strictest regulatory control.
