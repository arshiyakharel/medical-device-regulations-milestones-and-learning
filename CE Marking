Regulatory Process for medical devices
• Step 1 – Is your product a Medical Device?
• Step 2 – What is the Risk Class of your product?
• Step 3 – Do required Pre-Clinical and Clinical Tests
• Step 4 – Prepare Technical Documentation
• Step 5 – Implement Quality Management System
• Step 6 – Apply for assessment by Regulator
• Step 7 – Fulfill Pre-Market Requirements
• Step 8 – Perform Post-Market Surveillance

Types of medical products:
- Medicinal product - substance(s) to treat or prevent disease/ make a medical diagnosis etc. 
  Medical Device - an instrument apparaturs/ appliance/ material or other article including software for:
- diagnosis/prevention/monitoring/treatment etc of a disease/injury, control of conception. 
  Combination products: example: stent that releases a drug. Regulatory pathway very complex, out of scope for
this module

medical device taxonomy - medical devices can be split into categories:
- active medical device (needs an external energy source to operate i.e. pacemaker)
- passive medical device (no external energy device needed - hip implant)
- in-vitro medical device ()

medical devices can also be classified into categories: I, IIa, IIb.(see lecture slides)

  Different devices require different standards, this is the requirements hierarchy.
All devices will need essential standards a.k.a: Essential Requirements MDR 2017/745 - Annex I
some devices need extra standards and precaution - e.g.: (ISO 5832 Implants for surgery)

  Harmonised standards (EU medical device system)

In the EU, only standards developed by recognised European Standards Organisations are valid:
CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI

These standards are created at the request of the European Commission.
International standards can be aligned with European standards through:
Vienna Agreement (ISO ↔ CEN)
Dresden Agreement (IEC ↔ CENELEC)

These agreements allow standards to be adopted between global and European systems, reducing duplication.
General Safety and Performance (GSP) Requirements

Medical devices must meet the following core principles:
Any undesirable side effect must be an acceptable risk compared to the intended benefit.
Clinical evaluation is mandatory to demonstrate conformity.

Requirements cover:
Design and construction
Chemical, physical, and biological properties
Infection and microbial contamination
Environmental and construction-related risks
Devices with a measuring function
Protection against radiation
Devices connected to or using an energy source
Information provided by the manufacturer (e.g. instructions, warnings)

  Particular and device-specific requirements
ISO 16142-1:2016
Defines essential principles of safety and performance for non-IVD medical devices
Provides guidance on selecting applicable standards
Not yet harmonised under the EU MDR
ISO 14630
General requirements for non-active surgical implants
ISO 16061
General requirements for instruments used with non-active surgical implants
Class-specific requirements
ISO 21534 – Joint replacement implants (particular requirements)
Sub-class-specific requirements
ISO 21535 (parts 1–6) – Specific requirements for hip and knee joint replacement implants
• ISO 13485, Medical devices — Quality management systems — Requirements for regulatory purposes
• ISO 14971, Medical devices — Application of risk management to medical devices
(many more covered on slides)

Once a CE Mark is received:
 The company is free to market the device in the EU
• Certain countries outside of EU also recognize the CE Mark
• The CE Mark in and of itself does may not help with approval in the US/Japan, but a positive track record in the
EU may have a positive influence, and a negative track record can hurt you
• Provides additional strategic options to support a US submission

Post-market surveillance:
• Activate Medical Device Vigilance System, and compliance with Traceability requirements
• Users information translated in all languages of EEA countries in which the product is sold
• QMS maintenance and EC certificate renewal plans
