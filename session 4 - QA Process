REGULATORY PROCESS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES:
Step 1 – Is your product a Medical Device?
Step 2 – What is the Risk Class of your product?
Step 3 – Do required Pre-Clinical and Clinical Tests
Step 4 – Prepare Technical Documentation
Step 5 – Implement/Update Quality Management System
Step 6 – Apply for assessment by Regulator
Step 7 – Fulfill Pre-Market Requirements
Step 8 – Perform Post-Market Surveillance

STEP 1: Is your product a medical device?
Biological product: if manufactured in, extracted from, or semi-synthesized from biological sources; both drugs (i.e.
vaccine), or devices (i.e. porcine heart valve)
Non-biological product: if totally synthesized / manufactured. Among those:
• Medicinal product: intended action is achieved by pharmacological, metabolic, or immunological means
• Medical Device: intended action is not achieved by above means
• Combinatory product: intended action is partially achieved by above means

Medical Devices can be split into the following taxonomy:
- active medical device
- passive medical device
- in-vitro medical device 

STEP 2: what is the risk class of your product?
class I: low risk devices, only general controls required
class II: medium risk device, general and particular pre-clinical control required
class III: high risk, general, pre-clinical and clinical control required. 

EU MDR 2017/746 classifies devices alphabetically: A,B,C,D (low - high risk)
but then EU regulation 2017/745 states "devices shall be divided into Classes I, IIa, IIb, III according to Annex VIII"
ANNEX VIII is a classification criteria that provides guidelines on how to classify medical devices based on their use and risk posed.
It provides definitions for medical device types and rules on how to classify

CE(UK) vs. FDA(US)
CE – Rule Based: Risk classification in the CE system is rule-based; 18 rules guide you to identify (hopefully in a
deterministic way) which class risk your device is.
FDA – Similarity Based: in the FDA system risk class is defined mostly by similarity (FDA product classification
database, ~190 000 distinct device types!!). The simplified 510(k) premarket submission is a conformity route
available based on “substantial equivalence” to a predicate.

Understanding the FDA Medical Device Classification Process:
Class I (Low Risk): Subject to general controls, often exempt from premarket notification and 510(k) submission.
Class II (Moderate Risk): Requires special controls and usually a 510(k) submission.
Class III (High Risk): Requires the most stringent review, typically through Premarket Approval (PMA).

510(k) Submission:
> this is a premarket submission given to the FDA demonstrating that a new device is "substantially equivalent"
to a legally marketed predicate device. The new device should have the same intended use and similar technological characteristics.
>If the FDA agrees the device is substantially equivalent, it gains clearance to market

De Novo Process:
If a device is new but has low to moderate risk, a de-novo classification can be requested
The FDA will class it into Class I or II instead of defaulting to class III.
If denied the device remain class III and goes through pre-market approval.

513(g) Request:
If unsure about a device classification, a  513(g) request can be submitted.

STEP 3 - Do required Pre-Clinical and Clinical Tests
The required tests before launching a medical device follows this heirarchy:
Basic Standards > Group Standards > Product Standards

Basic Standards> Apply across many products - broad
e.g.: Quality Management
ISO 9001:2015 (general)
ISO 13485:2016 (medical devices – mandatory in practice)
Risk Management
ISO 14971 (identification, evaluation, control of risks)
These are foundational and apply to almost all devices.

Group Standards> apply to categories of devices e.g.: electrical medical devices, software, implants
e.g.: IEC 60601 series (electrical medical equipment)

Product Standards > Apply to specific devices ECG monitors, infusion pumps)
While Common Specifications were introduced under MDR to improve patient safety where standards are lacking, their ambiguous nature, limited availability, and mandatory status risk increasing regulatory uncertainty and may act as a barrier to innovation, particularly for novel medical technologies.

FDA 510(k) process:
The FDA 510(k) pathway is a premarket notification process, not a formal approval.
Central idea: Substantial Equivalence (SE)
A manufacturer must show that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device.

This involves four key steps:
Identify a Predicate Device
FDA-cleared, legally marketed device
Same intended use and similar technological characteristics
Analyse Differences

Are there differences in:
Materials?
Design?
Energy source?
Software or algorithms?

Critical question:
Do these differences raise new questions of safety or effectiveness?

Apply Appropriate Scientific Methods
Bench testing
Biocompatibility
Electrical safety
Software validation
Clinical data (only if necessary)
Evaluate Performance Data

If performance is equivalent to or better than the predicate
And no new safety/effectiveness questions arise
➜ Claim Substantial Equivalence

Role of Technical Standards in the 510(k) Program
Voluntary but Strongly Encouraged

Use of standards is voluntary, not mandatory
However:
“Whenever there is a standard, use it!”
Why?
Recognised standards provide accepted methods to demonstrate safety and performance
Reduce FDA review time
Increase regulatory predictability

If No Standard Exists
The burden shifts to the manufacturer to:
Justify the scientific validity of the chosen test methods
Demonstrate they appropriately address specific risks or performance claims

➡ This mirrors MDR logic, but without mandatory Common Specifications.

Sources of Technical Standards
International
ISO – primary global source for medical device standards
National / Regional
BSI – UK national standards body
ASTM, IEC, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI – sector-specific organisations

⚠️ Important distinction:
Standards bodies write standards
Notified Bodies (NBs) assess conformity
They are not the same, even if housed in the same organisation (e.g. BSI)

European Harmonised Standards (Contextual Link)
Through the Vienna Agreement (ISO ↔ CEN) and Dresden Agreement (IEC ↔ CENELEC):
International standards can be adopted as European harmonised standards
The European Commission formally:
Requests
Recognises
Publishes harmonised standards
Compliance gives presumption of conformity under MDR (unless overridden by Common Specifications)
