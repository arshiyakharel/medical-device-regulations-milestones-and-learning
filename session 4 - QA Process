REGULATORY PROCESS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES:
Step 1 – Is your product a Medical Device?
Step 2 – What is the Risk Class of your product?
Step 3 – Do required Pre-Clinical and Clinical Tests
Step 4 – Prepare Technical Documentation
Step 5 – Implement/Update Quality Management System
Step 6 – Apply for assessment by Regulator
Step 7 – Fulfill Pre-Market Requirements
Step 8 – Perform Post-Market Surveillance

STEP 1: Is your product a medical device?
Biological product: if manufactured in, extracted from, or semi-synthesized from biological sources; both drugs (i.e.
vaccine), or devices (i.e. porcine heart valve)
Non-biological product: if totally synthesized / manufactured. Among those:
• Medicinal product: intended action is achieved by pharmacological, metabolic, or immunological means
• Medical Device: intended action is not achieved by above means
• Combinatory product: intended action is partially achieved by above means

Medical Devices can be split into the following taxonomy:
- active medical device
- passive medical device
- in-vitro medical device 

STEP 2: what is the risk class of your product?
class I: low risk devices, only general controls required
class II: medium risk device, general and particular pre-clinical control required
class III: high risk, general, pre-clinical and clinical control required. 

EU MDR 2017/746 classifies devices alphabetically: A,B,C,D (low - high risk)
but then EU regulation 2017/745 states "devices shall be divided into Classes I, IIa, IIb, III according to Annex VIII"
ANNEX VIII is a classification criteria that provides guidelines on how to classify medical devices based on their use and risk posed.
It provides definitions for medical device types and rules on how to classify

CE(UK) vs. FDA(US)
CE – Rule Based: Risk classification in the CE system is rule-based; 18 rules guide you to identify (hopefully in a
deterministic way) which class risk your device is.
FDA – Similarity Based: in the FDA system risk class is defined mostly by similarity (FDA product classification
database, ~190 000 distinct device types!!). The simplified 510(k) premarket submission is a conformity route
available based on “substantial equivalence” to a predicate.

Understanding the FDA Medical Device Classification Process:
Class I (Low Risk): Subject to general controls, often exempt from premarket notification and 510(k) submission.
Class II (Moderate Risk): Requires special controls and usually a 510(k) submission.
Class III (High Risk): Requires the most stringent review, typically through Premarket Approval (PMA).

510(k) Submission:
> this is a premarket submission given to the FDA demonstrating that a new device is "substantially equivalent"
to a legally marketed predicate device. The new device should have the same intended use and similar technological characteristics.
>If the FDA agrees the device is substantially equivalent, it gains clearance to market

De Novo Process:
If a device is new but has low to moderate risk, a de-novo classification can be requested
The FDA will class it into Class I or II instead of defaulting to class III.
If denied the device remain class III and goes through pre-market approval.

513(g) Request:
If unsure about a device classification, a  513(g) request can be submitted.
